				<h2>This is not working</h2>
				<br />
				In every way measurable, Mike Jinks is not working as head coach at Bowling Green. He began as head coach in 2016 after a run of unprecedented success in Falcon football.
				<br />The previous four years before Jinks began encompassed two head coaches. Those four years included four bowl games, three MAC East championships, and two MAC championships.
				<br />As soon as Mike Jinks took over, the program fell apart and has not improved. Under Mike Jinks' guidance, the team has vastly underperformed.
				<ul>
					<li>The worst two losses in modern Bowling Green football history</li>
					<li>A continuously underpeforming defense, even with changing defensive coordinators</li>
					<li>The nation's worst run defense</li>
					<li>Bottom of the MAC in nearly every defensive category for three years</li>
					<li>Seven total wins so far in three years</li>
					<li>Two close wins over FCS teams</li>
					<li><a href="https://bgsufalcons.com/news/2017/9/9/football-suder-ties-record-with-four-field-goals-in-bgsu-loss-to-coyotes.aspx">First loss to an FCS team in 30 years</a></li>
					<li>No non-conference FBS wins in three years</li>
					<li>No wins over bowl teams, so far in three years</li>
					<li>No wins over MAC teams playing their starting QB, so far in three years</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/Fan-Happiness-Index/espn-college-football-fan-happiness-index">Bottom of the nation in ESPN's "Fan Happiness Index"</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/DavidBriggs/2018/07/27/Heat-rising-on-Bowling-Green-s-Jinks-as-arrests-mount.html">Led the 2017-2018 offseason nationwide in most arrests nationwide</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/DavidBriggs/2018/07/27/Heat-rising-on-Bowling-Green-s-Jinks-as-arrests-mount.html">High attrition levels, which offset recruiting efforts</a></li>
				</ul> 
				<br />
				On the field, the Bowling Green football program has sunk to levels unimaginable after the successes prior to Jinks' arrival. 
				<br />
				As the final points above indicate, the problems with Bowling Green football under Mike Jinks extend to off the field as well.
				<br />
				This is not working. For the good of the future of Bowling Green football, it is time to replace Mike Jinks as Bowling Green Football's head coach.
				<br />
				We wish him the best in his career and hope he has future successes.
