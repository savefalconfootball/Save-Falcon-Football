				<h2>Comments from Falcons</h2>
				<br />
				Mike Jinks has taken one of the most devoted fans you could ever hope for and made him quit caring.
				<br />
				I feel for the current students. Only current seniors have ever seen a winning football program. The majority of students only know Mike Jinks as head coach and have witnessed mostly losses after losses.
