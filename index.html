				<h2>It is time for a change</h2>
				<br />
				We, the alumni and fans of the Bowling Green Falcons, wish to have our voices heard.
				<br />
				Mike Jinks is a good man and has a good family, and we thank him for his dedication to Bowling Green football. He has given it his best.
				<br />
				However, this is not working. We have seen enough. The football program needs a change in direction. See <a href="why.html"> why it is time for a change</a>.
				<br />
				The fans have spoken. See <a href="comments.html"> actual comments from Bowling Green fans and alumni</a> to understand what the community is thinking.
				<br />
				<a href="getinvolved.html">Get involved and make your voice known</a>.
				<br />
				We believe it is in the best interest of all involved for 2018 to be Mike Jinks' final season at Bowling Green.
				<br />
				We wish him the best in the future and thank him for his dedication.
				<br />
